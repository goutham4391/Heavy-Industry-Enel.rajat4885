00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.560 position:25% size:50%
What is the strategic theme of this decade?

2
00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.360 position:25% size:50%
The last one that we passed
was clearly the emergence

3
00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.400 position:25% size:50%
of renewables as a very competitive

4
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.680 position:25% size:50%
and important part of the value chain.

5
00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.640 position:25% size:50%
This one, I think,
is going to be the progressive electrification

6
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:19.680 position:25% size:50%
of energy demand around the world.

7
00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.160 position:25% size:50%
The decade where people will start thinking

8
00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:27.080 position:25% size:50%
of how they can live better using electricity,

9
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.160 position:25% size:50%
which is the basis, the pillar of the way

10
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.400 position:25% size:50%
we’ll be developing our strategy
in the next few years.

11
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.000 position:25% size:50%
The electrification, we see,

12
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.960 position:25% size:50%
is the last step towards a fully sustainable world,

13
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:42.520 position:25% size:50%
so a fully decarbonized world.

14
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.840 position:25% size:50%
Electrification means
that there are parts of our economy,

15
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.200 position:25% size:50%
parts of our private life that
will use electricity that before did not.

16
00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:53.560 position:25% size:50%
One big example for us is the great revolution

17
00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:55.720 position:25% size:50%
that is going on for the automotive industry

18
00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.960 position:25% size:50%
and all the mobility that will become electrified
in the next ten years,

19
00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.120 position:25% size:50%
and to prepare ourselves
for that needs a big investment.

20
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.120 position:25% size:50%
On the other side, we also need to make sure

21
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:07.400 position:25% size:50%
that we help customers understand
the value for them.

22
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.520 position:25% size:50%
What is the benefit they have in reducing their costs

23
00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:13.240 position:25% size:50%
and also reducing their carbon footprint.

24
00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.840 position:25% size:50%
It’s the perfect mix
between sustainability and business.

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.640 position:25% size:50%
Fighting climate change
is also good for the economy.

26
00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.200 position:25% size:50%
So the question is now:

27
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.120 position:25% size:50%
How fast are we going to do this?

28
00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.120 position:25% size:50%
And we found out during the strategic exercise

29
00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.800 position:25% size:50%
that we can indeed accelerate
our full decarbonization by ten years.

30
00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.800 position:25% size:50%
So, instead of 2050,
we brought back this deadline to 2040.

31
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.920 position:25% size:50%
That means that by then,
we will be having finished the substitution

32
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.520 position:25% size:50%
of thermal generation with renewables
in all geographies

33
00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:49.560 position:25% size:50%
and also switched a lot of customers

34
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.720 position:25% size:50%
that we are today serving with gas,
to electricity.

35
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.120 position:25% size:50%
Sustainability is at the core of our strategy

36
00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.200 position:25% size:50%
and defines how we empower
sustainable progress.

37
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.440 position:25% size:50%
We belong to the territory
and we are an essential element

38
00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.600 position:25% size:50%
in the lives of people,
business and society at large.

39
00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.080 position:25% size:50%
We’re doing this to help people improve
their quality of life because,

40
00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.800 position:25% size:50%
if you get more efficient in using your energy,

41
00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.320 position:25% size:50%
you also have a lower carbon footprint.

42
00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.640 position:25% size:50%
The environment will benefit.

43
00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:16.760 position:25% size:50%
And, by the way,

44
00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.280 position:25% size:50%
switching from one technology to another,
we know, creates jobs.

45
00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.800 position:25% size:50%
And that is going to help a lot of other companies

46
00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.880 position:25% size:50%
that work with us to accelerate
and benefit from this transition.

47
00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:33.800 position:25% size:50%
Our strategy is completely focused
on shared value.

48
00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.240 position:25% size:50%
For example, in the plan,

49
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.320 position:25% size:50%
you will see the value
that we will create to our clients

50
00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.880 position:25% size:50%
which will enjoy by 2030 a 40% reduction
in their energy spending,

51
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.560 position:25% size:50%
alongside an 80% reduction of their CO2 footprint.

52
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.480 position:25% size:50%
In our plan, we have a 6% - 7% annual growth.

53
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.120 position:25% size:50%
We couple these with more than 94% of Capex

54
00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:57.440 position:25% size:50%
linked to Sustainable Development targets.

55
00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.040 position:25% size:50%
Sustainable finance will have to increase
the instruments

56
00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.800 position:25% size:50%
and everything to finance and fuel,

57
00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:07.240 position:25% size:50%
so financed in a sustainable way.

58
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:11.160 position:25% size:50%
To our shareholders,
we confirm our dividend policy running on

59
00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.960 position:25% size:50%
a fixed and visible dividend,

60
00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.000 position:25% size:50%
which together with our earnings growth,

61
00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.760 position:25% size:50%
will support a total return of around 13%.
